        string file_name;     
        ifstream file(file_name, ios::binary);   // this part will help to open the file
        if (!file.is_open())
        {
            cerr << "Error opening file: " << file_name << endl;
            close(client);
        }
BUG:
Bug here is that we are not initializing file name and that will mean that compiler is trying to open a file which is not declared. Thus, resulting in not opening any file and causing an error
The aim behind statistical debugging is to find defects in programs by utilizing statistical models of success or failure.
These statistical models reveal connections between particular program behaviours and a run's ultimate success or failure.
So, in this situation if we find out that file is not being read. we can check where file is initialized. And that is how we will find the bug.
